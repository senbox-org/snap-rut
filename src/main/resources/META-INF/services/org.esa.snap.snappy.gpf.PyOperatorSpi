# In order to publish the python operators in this plugin module to SNAP, they need to be listed in this file. On each
# line an operator class is specified by its fully qualified name.
# A fully specified name includes the Python package path and the class name both separated by dot characters ('.').
# For example:
#
# cloud_mask.CloudMaskOp
# water.mci.MciOp
# land.ndvi.NdviOp
# land_ops.FaparOp
#
# Following Python conventions, the last name in the package path must therefore either be subpackage or a Python
# file. For the 'water.mci.MciOp' entry above, the pysical representation could either be:
# (a)  water/mci.py  where mci.py defines the MciOp class
# (b)  water/mci/__init__.py  where __init__.py defines the MciOp class

s2_rut.S2RutOp
