<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The S2-RUT produces per-pixel uncertainty of ESA Sentinel-2 L1C MSI products at a specified confidence level. The
    uncertainty combination of different pixels in a Region-of-Interest (ROI) is not a trivial process.
    <b>When combining the uncertainty from different pixels, the users should discard methods as the standard deviation
        of the mean or the straightforward combination of the pixels' uncertainty</b>.
    Instead, the users need to consider the correlation between different pixels.
</p>
<p>
    In order to calculate the uncertainty associated with a pixels' mean, two separate methods have been developed and
    they are separately explained in the following sections. More details can be found in the associated publication:
    <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
</p>

<h3>Select and deselect contributors</h3>

<p>
    The "select/deselect" method uses the capability of the S2-RUT to generate uncertainty images for selected
    uncertainty contributors to estimate the total uncertainty of the average reflectance of a ROI.
</p>
<p>
    In this approach we assign each effect to being either correlated (not reduced by averaging over the ROI), or
    uncorrelated (reduced by averaging over the ROI) and select only the correlated effects, assuming that the
    uncorrelated effects become negligible at the scale of the ROI. Each effect is discussed in <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>,
    which describes how decisions were made. Note that effects may be correlated in one dimension (e.g. spatial) and
    uncorrelated in another (e.g. temporal or spectral). The associated correlation should be evaluated experimentally
    if feasible by studying the combined variations of the quantities or using any available additional data pertaining
    to their interrelationship. Additionally, or in the absence of available data information based on experience and
    general knowledge can be utilised <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The method named "select/deselect" is intended to be as simple and quick as possible for the S2 L1C data users. In
    this method, the user interface incorporates a tick option to select individual effects, as shown below:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/selectdeselectcontributors.png" width="20%" height="70%" border=0></p>

<p>
    The user can run the S2-RUT with unselected <i>instrument noise</i>, <i>Crosstalk</i>, <i>ADC_quantisation</i> and
    <i>L1C image quantisation</i> since they are considered as nearly uncorrelated in time and space domain. In
    addition, the user can optionally unselect <i>OOF straylight-random</i> and <i>Gamma knowledge</i> since they are
    considered as correlated in time but uncorrelated in space.In such cases, the method can been adapted to produce two
    uncertainty images with the partially correlated contributions selected and deselected. The result is taken as the
    mean of the two ROI pixels for the two images.
</p>
<p>
    The result is an uncertainty image with only correlated components. An example for S2A B3 in a 500m ROI in Gobabeb
    is shown below:
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ROI_B3_rut.png" width="30%" height="40%" border=0></p>

<p>
    The result has minimum uncertainty variations (from 1.6% to 1.7%) and the value of either one pixel or the mean
    uncertainty over an specific area can be taken as an approximmation of the uncertainty associated to a pixels' mean.
</p>
<p>
    The approach is very simple but has several limitations. For example, for ROIs of just a few pixels, the assumption
    that the random effects become insignificant may not be sufficient. Thus, this method must be tested to understand
    the validity of the ROI size at which this assumption is valid. The method also does not provide flexibility to cope
    with situations where the effect cannot be considered either perfectly correlated or perfectly uncorrelated.
</p>

<h3>Monte-Carlo pixel uncertainty propagation</h3>

<p>
    The Monte-Carlo Method (MCM) determines the mean TOA reflectance factor for a ROI from the pixels over many
    iterations. At each iteration, the error associated with the reflectance factor is drawn from the distribution of
    each uncertainty contribution. If the uncertainty contribution is correlated between the pixels, the same sample is
    used for all the pixels in the ROI, whereas, if the uncertainty contribution is uncorrelated, a different error is
    drawn from the distribution for each pixel. Where there is partial correlation, two separate errors are drawn, one
    that is common to all pixels and one which is different from pixel to pixel. The distributions are set as normal or
    uniform distributions with a spread of values directly linked to the uncertainty as calculated directly from the
    S2-RUT. This uncertainty is obtained by generating an image of the specific uncertainty contribution. The method is
    illustrated below:
</p>

<h3>Running the Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation</h3>
<p>
    The RUT does incorporate from version 2, the possibility to replicate a full Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation of
    the pixels in a ROI. The process is not straightforward but here below the execution is detailed step-by-step:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Select the S2 L1C product. E.g. <i>S2A_MSIL1C_20170609T084601_N0205_R107_T33KWP_20170609T090644.SAFE</i>
    </li>
    <li>Process its uncertainty image in BEAM-DIMAP format for the desired bands (all uncertainty contributions must be
        selected) E.g.<i>B3</i>, <i>B8A</i> and <i>B12</i>. Save it with the default extension i.e. S2 product name +
        <i>_rut</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Process its uncertainty image in BEAM-DIMAP format for the desired bands but with only spatial and temporal
        correlated components as explained in the Section Select and deselect contributors. Save it with the extension
        <i>_rutroi</i> in the same folder as the previous uncertainty product.
    </li>
    <li>4) Process uncertainty images of specific contributors in BEAM-DIMAP format for the desired bands. Do this by
        only selecting the specific contributor in the GUI each time and save the uncertainty product in the same folder
        as the previous ones. For each specific contributor, specify the output product with the default S2 product name
        plus a specific tag for each one as follows:
        <i>_rut</i>.
        <table style="width:50%" align="center">
            <tr>
                <th>Contributor</th>
                <th>Tag</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Instrument noise</td>
                <td><i>_rutunoise</i></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>OOF straylight systematic</td>
                <td><i>_rutu_stray_sys</i></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td><i>_rutADC</i></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>DS stability</td>
                <td><i>_rutds</i></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>L1C image quantisation</td>
                <td><i>_rutuL1Cquant</i></td>
            </tr>
