<h3>Sentinel-2 Radiometric Uncertainty Tool (S2-RUT)</h3>
<p>
    The S2-RUT produces per-pixel uncertainty of ESA Sentinel-2 L1C MSI products at a specified confidence level. The L1
    uncertainty budget is based on a detailed L1 radiometric assessment and its combination based on the GUM guidelines.
    Flexibility as a SNAP processor provides opportunities to: specify confidence level, specify output format,
    select/deselect contributors.
